# Wireframes and Prototype Build

These wireframes were created to outline the basic structure of the site. The current version is fairly close to these, the main changes are to the logo text, which has been changed to spread over two lines instead of one, to fit better onto small screen sizes, and to the social links, which have been moved to be above the cards in the footer, as I thought they might not be noticed right at the bottom of the page.
